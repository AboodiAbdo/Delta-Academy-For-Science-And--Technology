# 🚀 Delta University Network Infrastructure

---

## 🌍 Overview

This repository contains a **comprehensive** network infrastructure project for **Delta University**, integrating **routers, switches, servers, firewalls, and wireless solutions** to establish a **highly secure, scalable, and high-performance network** for academic and administrative operations.

---

## 🏗️ Network Architecture

The network is designed to ensure **high availability, security, and scalability** through a structured topology:

- **🔹 Core Layer:** High-performance routers and switches for backbone connectivity
- **🔹 Distribution Layer:** VLAN segmentation and intelligent traffic routing
- **🔹 Access Layer:** Secure end-user connectivity with robust authentication

---

## 🔧 Hardware & Software Components

- **📡 Routers:** Cisco routers with **OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP** for dynamic routing
- **🖧 Switches:** Layer 2 & Layer 3 switching with **VLANs, trunking, and QoS**
- **🖥️ Servers:** Hosting DHCP, DNS, Web, Email, and Security services
- **🛡️ Firewalls:** **Next-Gen Firewalls** with deep packet inspection & intrusion prevention
- **📶 Wireless Access Points:** **Wi-Fi 6** deployment with WPA3 encryption
- **📊 Network Monitoring:** SNMP, Syslog, **NetFlow**, and AI-driven traffic analysis

---

## 🔍 Services & Implementations

- **📌 DHCP Server:** Automated IP assignment & lease management
- **🌐 DNS Server:** Internal & external domain resolution
- **🕸️ Web Hosting:** Apache/Nginx for hosting university applications
- **🔒 Security Features:** Firewall rules, **Zero Trust architecture**, and IDS/IPS
- **📁 File Sharing:** NAS, FTP, and distributed storage solutions
- **🔑 VPN & Remote Access:** Secure SSL/IPSec-based VPN configurations
- **📧 Email System:** Postfix/Dovecot-based **university mail infrastructure**
- **♻️ Backup & Disaster Recovery:** Automated **redundant backups & failover solutions**
